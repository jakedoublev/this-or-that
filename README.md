# this-or-that

## Purpose

It is hard to rank a list of priorities against each other.

`this-or-that` makes it easier by taking in a list of options and simply asking
"this or that" until the stack ranking is complete.

One tradeoff at a time, over and over, until the order is clear.

Data never leaves your browser and does not save between refreshes, so your decision stays 100% private.
